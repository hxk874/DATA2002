4.1 Tablet devises

Observed chi squared test

We always assume H0 is true. 

```{r}
y_i = c(102, 32, 12, 4) # actual value
p_i = c(0.69, 0.21, 0.07, 0.03) # H0 distribution
n = sum(y_i) # 150
e_i = n * p_i # expected values
```

combine the last two groups since there appear frequency values below 5.
```{r}
y_i = c(102, 32, 12 + 4) # actual value
p_i = c(0.69, 0.21, 0.07 + 0.03) # H0 distribution
n = sum(y_i) # 150
e_i = n * p_i # expected values
```

Use formula from slides
```{r}
t0 = sum((y_i - e_i)^2 / e_i)
```
How well does our observed data fit the expected data?

Since t0 = 0.0963, we will now find the p-value

if p-val is < 0.05 => reject
if p-val is > 0.05 => reject

```{r}
p_value = pchisq(t0, df=2, lower.tail = FALSE)
p_value 
```

```{r}
chisq.test(y_i, p=p_i)
```
