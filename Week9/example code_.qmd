## Air pollution

The data frame `environmental` has four environmental variables `ozone`, `radiation`, `temperature` and `wind` taken in New York City from May to September of 1973.

111 different observations of 4 different parameters

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data("environmental", package = "lattice")
# ?environmental
glimpse(environmental)
```

```{r}
p = ggplot(environmental) + aes(x = temperature, y = ozone) + 
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.6) + 
  labs(x = "Temperature (°F)", y = "Ozone concentration\n(parts per billion)")
p
```
Does it look like there is a connection?
- yes


Add a linear linear model.
```{r}
p + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

```{r}
lm1 = lm(ozone ~ temperature, # numeric outcome ~ predictor
         data = environmental)
lm1
```
$$\hat{\beta}_0 = -147.646 \,\ \,\ , \,\ \,\ \hat{\beta}_1 = 2.439$$
Our estimated model is:
$$\hat{\text{ozone}} =-147.646 + 2.439 \times \text{temp}$$

### Fitted values and residuals

The fitted values ($\hat{y}$) are obtained by plugging the observed predictor ($x$) values into our estimated model, $\hat{y}_i = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_i$.
```{r}
environmental = environmental |> 
  mutate(
    fitted = -147.646 + 2.439 * temperature
  )
```


The residuals are the differences between the observed outcome variable ($y$) and the value the estimated model predicts for that observation (the fitted value, $\hat{y}$),
$$r_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i$$


Extract the residuals and fitted values from the `lm1` object directly:

```{r}
environmental = environmental |> 
  mutate(
    resid = lm1$residuals,
    fitted = lm1$fitted.values
  )
```

Alternatively we could have used the `augment()` function from the **broom** package to do this:
- extract used variables: ozone, temperature and assigns values 
```{r}
broom::augment(lm1) |> glimpse()
```
## The lm object

What other hidden treasures does the `lm1` object hold?

All the values computed in the linear model: 
```{r}
names(lm1)

# important is:
# lm1$resid     : partial matching 
# lm1$residuals : type completion

# lm1$coef, lm1$coefficients : partial matching, type completion
# ...
```


E.g. we can extract the coefficients:

```{r}
lm1$coefficients
```

Or we can use the `tidy()` function from the **broom** package:

```{r}
lm1 |> broom::tidy()
```

# Checking assumptions

## Linear regression assumptions

There are 4 assumptions underling our linear regression model:
 1. Linearity - the relationship between $Y$ and $x$is linear
 2. Independence - all the errors are independent of each other
 3. Homoskedasticity - the errors have constant variance Var$(\varepsilon_i) = \sigma^2$ for all $i=1,...n$.
 4. Normality - the errors follow a normal distribution

The last three can be written succinctly as $\varepsilon_i \sim$ iid $N(0,\sigma^2)$.


```{r}
p1 = environmental |> ggplot() + 
  aes(x = temperature, y = ozone) + 
  geom_point(size = 2) + 
  labs(x = "Temperature (°F)",
       y = "Ozone concentration") +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE)
p1
```

```{r}
p2 = environmental |> ggplot() + 
  aes(x = temperature, y = resid) + 
  geom_point(size = 2) + 
  labs(x = "Temperature (°F)",
       y = "Residual") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color="blue")
p2
```
overestimate: negative $\varepsilon_i$
underestimate: positive $\varepsilon_i$

```{r}
p2 + geom_smooth(method = "loess", # local smothing
                 se = FALSE, color="red")
```
= pattern that we would want to do somehting about. 

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/slide20.png")
```

### Consider taking the log

```{r, fig.height=7}
p1 + scale_y_log10()
```

```{r}
environmental = environmental |> 
  mutate(lozone = log(ozone))
lm2 = lm(lozone ~ temperature, data = environmental)
lm2
```

```{r}
environmental = environmental |> 
  mutate(
    lfitted = lm2$fitted.values,
    lresid = lm2$residuals
  )
```

```{r}
p1 = environmental |> ggplot() + 
  aes(x = temperature, y = lozone) + 
  geom_point(size = 3) + 
  theme_classic(base_size = 15) + 
  labs(x="Temperature (°F)",
       y="Log ozone concentration") +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE)
p1
```

```{r}
p2 = environmental |> ggplot() + 
  aes(x = temperature, y = lresid) + 
  geom_point(size = 2) + 
  theme_classic(base_size = 15) + 
  labs(x = "Temperature (°F)",
       y = "Residual") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color="blue") + theme_grey()
p2
```

## Assumption 4: normality

```{r}
environmental |> ggplot() + 
  aes(sample = lresid) +
  geom_qq(size = 2) + geom_qq_line()
```
- points reasonable close, some outliers in the lower corner => but is almost as good as you will ever see


The **ggfortify** package provides an `autoplot()` method for `lm` objects.
- Generates best plot for specific data
```{r, fig.height=5.5, warning=FALSE}
library(ggfortify)
autoplot(lm2, which = 1:2)
```

# Interpreting model coefficients

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
data(environmental, package = "lattice")
environmental = environmental |> 
  mutate(lozone = log(ozone))
lm2 = lm(lozone ~ temperature, data = environmental)
lm2
```


Aside: nicer model output, another way to output the model
```{r}
#install.packages("sjPlot")
sjPlot::tab_model(
  lm2, 
  show.ci = FALSE,
  dv.labels = "Log Ozone")
```

```{r, results = "asis"}
install.packages("equatiomatic")
library(equatiomatic)

extract_eq(lm2)
extract_eq(lm2, use_coefs = TRUE)
```

```{r}
environmental |> ggplot() + aes(x = temperature, y = lozone) + 
  geom_point() + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,100), ylim = c(-2, 5.5)) + 
  geom_abline(slope = 0.06767, intercept = -1.84852, colour = "red") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0) 
```

## Interpreting models with log transformations


```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/slide38.png")
```
- look into the "lec27_notes.pdf"


# Inference in regression models

- checking whether the slope is = 0 : $y = \hat{\beta}_0$
  - to find out: do $t$-test
  
$$T= \frac{\hat{\beta}_1 - \beta_1}{SE(\hat{\beta}_1)} \sim t_{n-2}$$
```{r}
summary(lm2)
```
estimate = 0.06767 - 0 = t-statistic

p-value as least as big as 11.654 = very small (significant) => reject
  - this is a two tail p-value
  - not enough just to show your boss a small p-value. You have to explain in regards to the data (assumptions, limitations, plots...)

df associated with the t-dist = 109
-which is th df that the p-value used: 

$$
2 P(t_{109} \geq 11.654
$$

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/slide44.png")
```


To be more precise:
```{r}
summary(lm2)$coefficients |> round(4)
```

### CI for regression coefficients

```{r}
confint(lm2) |> round(3)

summary(lm2)
```
temperature CI: 0 $\notin$ (0.056,0.079) = reject

If CI contains zero (no difference), we do not have sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a difference.


Or the `tab_model()` function from **sjPlot**.

```{r}
sjPlot::tab_model(lm2, dv.labels = "Log Ozone")
```


# Multiple regression

- wind: negative relationship
    linear...
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(GGally)
GGally::ggpairs(environmental)
```
Add in more predictors
  - radiation ($x_1$), temp($x_2$), wind ($x_3$)
```{r}
lm3 = lm(lozone ~ radiation + temperature + wind, environmental)
summary(lm3)$coefficients |> round(3)
```
$$
\hat{\log(ozone)} = -0.261 + 0.003x_1 + 0.049x_2 -0.062x_3
$$


interpreticing the coef in a marg prespective => not always a reasonable way 

• A 1° Fahrenheit increase in temperature results in a 4.9% increase in ozone on average, holding radiation and wind speed constant.
• A one langley increase solar radiation results in a 0.3% increase in ozone on average, holding radiation and wind constant.
• A 10 langley increase solar radiation results in a 3% increase in ozone on average, holding radiation and wind constant.
• A one mile per hour increase in average wind speed results in a 6.2% decrease in ozone on average, holding radiation and temperature constant.


## In-sample performance

## Simple linear regression model

summary(lm2)$r.squared
```

## "Full" model

                  show.ci = FALSE)
```
